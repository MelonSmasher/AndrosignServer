AndrosignServer
===============

Server and CMS for android signage app.

This is the backend for the Androsign Client. It is used as a CMS to control the content on the android device remotly.

This server along with the Client and an inexpensive Android pc stick are being used for a signage solution at a university that I work at. Because of this there might be a few hard coded values in either this or the client that need to change. If you find any submit a pull request to make that parameter dynamic.

At this point I have a basic CMS and Client created but would like to progress this project further, contributions are welcome!
